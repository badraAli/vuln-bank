This code contains multiple critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker to compromise the application, steal sensitive data, or perform unauthorized actions. Below is a detailed analysis of the vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited, and recommendations for fixing them.



1. Hardcoded Secret Key (CWE-798)
Location: app.secret_key = "super_secret_key_123"

Risk: The secret key is hardcoded and predictable. This allows attackers to forge session cookies and impersonate users.

Exploit: An attacker can decode or forge session cookies to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or escalate privileges.

Fix: Use a strong, randomly generated secret key stored in environment variables or a secure configuration file.



2. SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Location:

/login route: query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'"

/check_balance route: c.execute(f"SELECT username, balance FROM users WHERE account_number='{account_number}'")

/admin/create_admin route: c.execute(f"INSERT INTO users (username, password, account_number, is_admin) VALUES ('{username}', '{password}', '{account_number}', 1)")

Risk: User input is directly interpolated into SQL queries, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

Exploit:

In /login, an attacker could bypass authentication by injecting ' OR 1=1 -- as the username or password.

In /check_balance, an attacker could retrieve all user balances by injecting ' OR 1=1 -- as the account_number.

In /admin/create_admin, an attacker could inject malicious SQL to modify the database.

Fix: Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries to safely handle user input. For example:

python
Copy
c.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=? AND password=?", (username, password))



3. Mass Assignment Vulnerability (CWE-915)
Location: /register route: user_data = request.form.to_dict()

Risk: The application blindly accepts all form data, allowing attackers to inject additional fields (e.g., is_admin) to escalate privileges.

Exploit: An attacker could send a POST request with is_admin=1 to create an admin account.

Fix: Explicitly define and validate the allowed fields for user registration.



4. Excessive Data Exposure (CWE-213)
Location: /register route: sensitive_data and custom headers (X-Debug-Info, X-User-Info, X-Registration-Query).

Risk: Sensitive data such as passwords, account numbers, and raw form data is exposed in the response.

Exploit: An attacker could intercept the response to steal sensitive information.

Fix: Avoid exposing sensitive data in responses. Only return necessary information.



5. Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) (CWE-639)
Location: /check_balance/<account_number> route.

Risk: The endpoint does not verify if the logged-in user is authorized to access the requested account.

Exploit: An attacker could check the balance of any account by guessing or brute-forcing account numbers.

Fix: Ensure the logged-in user is authorized to access the requested account. For example:

python
Copy
if account_number != user[3]:  # user[3] is the logged-in user's account number
    return jsonify({'error': 'Unauthorized'}), 403


6. Race Condition (CWE-362)
Location: /transfer route.

Risk: The balance check and update are not atomic, allowing attackers to exploit timing issues to overdraft accounts.

Exploit: An attacker could initiate multiple simultaneous transfers to withdraw more money than available.

Fix: Use database transactions to ensure atomicity:

python
Copy
with conn:
    c.execute("SELECT balance FROM users WHERE id=?", (session['user_id'],))
    balance = c.fetchone()[0]
    if balance >= amount:
        c.execute("UPDATE users SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id=?", (amount, session['user_id']))
        c.execute("UPDATE users SET balance = balance + ? WHERE account_number=?", (amount, to_account))



7. Insecure Session Management
Location: Session handling throughout the application.

Risk: The application does not enforce secure session practices (e.g., session expiration, secure cookies).

Exploit: An attacker could hijack sessions or reuse stale sessions.

Fix: Configure secure session settings:

python
Copy
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(minutes=30)


8. Security Through Obscurity
Location: /sup3r_s3cr3t_admin route.

Risk: Relying on obscurity (hidden endpoint) for security is ineffective.

Exploit: An attacker could discover the endpoint through brute-forcing or directory scanning.

Fix: Implement proper access control and authentication for admin endpoints.


9. Debug Mode Enabled
Location: app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)

Risk: Debug mode exposes detailed error messages and stack traces, which can reveal sensitive information.

Exploit: An attacker could trigger errors to gather information about the application.

Fix: Disable debug mode in production:

python
Copy
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=False)


10. Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization
Location: Throughout the application (e.g., /register, /login, /transfer).

Risk: User input is not validated or sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious data.

Exploit: Attackers could inject malicious payloads (e.g., XSS, command injection).

Fix: Validate and sanitize all user input. For example:

python
Copy
from flask import escape
username = escape(request.form['username'])


11. Insecure Password Storage
Location: Passwords are stored in plaintext in the database.

Risk: If the database is compromised, attackers can easily retrieve user passwords.

Exploit: An attacker could dump the database and use the passwords for credential stuffing.

Fix: Hash passwords using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt):

python
Copy
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)


12. Missing CSRF Protection
Risk: The application does not implement CSRF protection, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

Exploit: An attacker could trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions (e.g., transferring money).

Fix: Use Flask-WTF or Flask-SeaSurf to implement CSRF protection.




Recommendations for Secure Development
Use a secure framework (e.g., Flask-Security) to handle authentication, authorization, and session management.

Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

Perform security testing (e.g., penetration testing, code reviews).

Follow the principle of least privilege and enforce access control at every level.
